## ‚ú® Features

* **Random Quotes:** Displays a random quote and its author when the page loads.
* **New Quote Generation:** Clicking the "New Quote" button fetches and displays a new random quote from the API.
* **Share on X (ex-Twitter):** Clicking the "Tweet" button opens an X intent window with the current quote pre-populated, ready for sharing.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and centered on the page, ensuring a great user experience on any device.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **React:** Used for building the component-based user interface and managing application state with `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
* **Vite:** Serves as the modern, fast frontend build tool.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Utilized for the core application logic, including `async/await` for asynchronous API calls.
* **Bootstrap 5:** Employed for its powerful and responsive layout utilities, especially the Flexbox grid for centering content.
* **Sass:** Used for custom styling and organization of CSS (future improvements).
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** The foundational languages for the structure and final presentation.
* **Quotable API:** Used for fetching random quote data.

## üé® Future Improvements

* Integrate Google Fonts for improved typography.
* Replace the text-based "Tweet" link with a modern X SVG icon.
* Add a subtle box-shadow and rounded corners to the quote box for a polished, card-like appearance.
* Implement a dynamic color scheme where the background color of the page and quote box changes smoothly with each new quote.
